Each role plays a critical part in delivering a polished, full-featured web application. In small teams, individuals may take on multiple roles to drive the project forward.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project leverages a modern full-stack architecture using robust and scalable technologies. Each component plays a specific role in delivering functionality, performance, and maintainability.

### 🔙 Backend

- **Django**  
  A high-level Python web framework used to build secure and maintainable web applications. In this project, Django powers the RESTful API and handles business logic, user authentication, and routing.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**  
  An extension of Django for building flexible and powerful APIs. DRF enables easy serialization, viewsets, and API authentication mechanisms for the frontend to consume.

### 🗃️ Database

- **PostgreSQL**  
  A powerful open-source relational database system. It stores user profiles, listings, bookings, reviews, and payment records. PostgreSQL is known for its reliability and SQL standards compliance.

### 🔗 API Layer

- **GraphQL** (optional / advanced layer)  
  A modern query language for APIs, allowing clients to request exactly what they need. If implemented, it would offer an alternative to REST and enable efficient data retrieval.

### 🎨 Frontend

- **HTML5 & CSS3**  
  Fundamental technologies for building structured content and styling. These define the layout, typography, colors, and responsiveness of the UI.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
  Enables interactivity in the user interface, including dynamic content updates, form validation, modals, and more.

- **React.js** (optional)  
  A JavaScript library for building fast, responsive, and component-based UIs. React simplifies frontend development by managing UI state and rendering efficiently.

### 🧪 Testing

- **PyTest / Django Test Framework**  
  Ensures backend logic is robust and bug-free through unit and integration tests.

- **Postman**  
  Used to manually test and document REST/GraphQL endpoints during development.

### 🚀 Deployment & DevOps

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Version control and collaboration tools to track changes, manage branches, and host the codebase.

- **Docker** (optional)  
  Containers for bundling and deploying the application in isolated, reproducible environments.

- **Heroku / AWS**  
  Platforms for deploying the web app, making it accessible via a public URL with backend and database connectivity.

---

This technology stack ensures the application is fast, secure, and scalable — ideal for replicating core AirBnB features in a production-style environment.
